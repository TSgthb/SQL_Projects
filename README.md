## Repository Overview

<p align="justify">
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a data analytics pipeline, showcasing practical implementations of data engineering and analytical concepts using SQL. 

Each project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and includes the following stages:
</p>

- __Data Extraction__: This includes pulling datasets from online sources, such as Kaggle.
- __Data Ingestion & Cleaning__: This involves importing raw data which is present in the form of flat files into a structured environment that has been prepared by analyzing the requirements, handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies and finally standardizing formats for dates, strings, and categorical variables.
- __Data Transformation & Analysis__: This includes the creation of derived columns, calculated metrics and aggregations to reshape and enrich the data, support analysis and derive insights to solve business problems.

<p align="justify">
The projects span a wide range of concepts, ranging from: 
</p>

- __Foundational techniques__ like basic data exploration, string operations, conditional logic and date manipulations, to
- __Advanced SQL features__ including aggregations, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), subqueries, temporary tables, views and stored procedures for modular and reusable logic.
